I grew up in a small town in Central Pennsylvania and spent much of my time learning about computers and making ridiculous movies with my friends.

At Williams I served as president and root of [Williams Students
Online][wso], competed on and co-captained the track and field team,
and wrote a senior thesis with [Duane Bailey][duane]. I also spent a
semester [studying math in Budapest, Hungary.][bsm]
