At Williams I served as president and root of [Williams Students
Online][wso], competed on and co-captained the track and field team,
and wrote a senior thesis with [Duane Bailey][duane]. I also spent a
semester [studying math in Budapest, Hungary.][bsm]

My undergraduate research, apart from my senior thesis, is completely
orthogonal to my current research interests.
