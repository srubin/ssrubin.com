![My first trip to Tahoe (Squaw Valley)](img/snowboarding-fade.jpg)

My hobbies include listening to music and going to shows

* [my last.fm profile][lastfm]
* [Sgt. Pepper's Strawberry Jam][pj], my music blog

watching professional (and occasionally college) sports

* Go Steelers, Ephs, Bears, Lakers, Pirates, Sixers, Orange, and Tiger

working out and hiking, working on toy software projects,

* [vinyl-fm][vfm] (scrobble vinyl records automatically)
* [lastday][lastday] (cross-reference last.fm profile with black cab and daytrotter sessions)
* [microphone][microphone] (process streaming microphone input in the browser)


and, as of the Winter of 2013, snowboarding.
