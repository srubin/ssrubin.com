I am broadly interested in HCI, music, media editing, information
visualization, and design. In my time at Berkeley, I worked on
audio editing interfaces, crowdsourcing graphical perception studies,
bribe-reporting, a cup that knows what you're drinking, and chart-data
extraction.

My undergraduate senior thesis developed a methodology for visualizing
large, highly symmetric communication graphs, such as process
communication graphs from parallel programs.
