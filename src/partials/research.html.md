I am broadly interested in HCI, music, information visualization, and
design. In my first two years at Berkeley, I have worked on audio
editing interfaces, crowdsourcing graphical perception studies
(unpublished), bribe-reporting, a cup that knows what you're drinking,
and chart-data extraction.

My undergraduate senior thesis developed a methodology for visualizing
large, highly symmetric communication graphs, such as process
communication graphs from parallel programs.
