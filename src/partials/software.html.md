I've written a lot of software for my research. I'm hoping to
eventually release a lot of this code. Here's what I've released so
far:

* [radiotool](http://github.com/ucbvislab/radiotool) &mdash; a python
  library that aims to make it easy to create audio by piecing
  together bits of other audio files. This library was originally
  written to enable my research in audio editing user interfaces, but
  perhaps someone else might find it useful.
