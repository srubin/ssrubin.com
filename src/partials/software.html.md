In grad school, I wrote a lot of software for my research. Here are some some things I released:

* [speecheditor](https://ucbvislab.github.io/speecheditor) &mdash; a web app for editing and adding musical scores to audio stories. Instead of editing speech using waveforms, the speecheditor allows you to edit audio with text, like a word processor. Likewise, it allows users to easily loop musical tracks and add [musical underlays](http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/underscore) Ã  la This American Life. The speecheditor is described in detail in our paper, ["Content-based Tools for Editing Audio Stories."](http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/audiostories)
* [radiotool](http://github.com/ucbvislab/radiotool) &mdash; a python
  library that aims to make it easy to create audio by piecing
  together bits of other audio files. I wrote this library to enable my research in audio editing user interfaces, but
  perhaps someone else might find it useful.
