Today we've released our [speecheditor](https://ucbvislab.github.io/speecheditor), a web app for editing and adding musical scores to audio stories. Instead of editing speech using waveforms, the speecheditor allows you to edit audio with text, like a word processor. Likewise, it allows users to easily loop musical tracks and add [musical underlays](http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/underscore) Ã  la This American Life. The speecheditor is described in detail in our paper, ["Content-based Tools for Editing Audio Stories."](http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/audiostories)

The speecheditor is research code. To that extent, this release is a polished prototype &ndash; there are bound to be bugs that arise (please file those on the github issues page!) but we've had a lot of fun editing audio stories with this system and we believe it's a powerful paradigm for DAWs of the future. We're excited to have other creators try it out!
