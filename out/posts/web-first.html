        <p>When I started grad school in the Fall of 2011, I didn&#39;t consider
myself to be an excellent programmer or a <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">hacker</a> or anything
like that. On the other hand, I did consider myself to be an
exceptional googler and <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/research/opportunistic/">tinkerer</a>; I could usually scrounge
up a solution to my current programming problem without much
difficulty.</p>
<p>My first research project in grad school involved a javascript-heavy
experiment that we were going to deploy to Mechanical Turk. I had done
my fair share of tinkering with client-side (HTML/CSS) and server-side
(Rails) web development, but I had always avoided javascript. No, I
don&#39;t know why.</p>
<p>Eager to show my collaborators that I was capable of writing code that
worked and writing it quickly, I dove into javascript&#39;s prototypical
deep end. My code, hideous as it was, worked fine and allowed for
rapid iteration.</p>
<p>Just to expand on the aforementioned hideousness, we&#39;re talking a
whole mess of global variables and inline HTML:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs javascript">$(<span class="hljs-string">'body'</span>).prepend(<span class="hljs-string">'&lt;span id="codespan"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter your code: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;input style="display: inline" id="turkcode" type="text" name="turkcode"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;&lt;button id="codebutton"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>My intention isn&#39;t to call out how bad I was at javascript a year and
half ago. I was inspired by the process. That project necessitated
that I build a web app, but my projects since then have been more
flexible. But all of my (and your, I&#39;m guessing) research
collaborators have a somewhat unbelievable number of devices that can
access the web, so ideally, my research should live on the web instead
of in some C++ or Java code that may not ever be compiled on anyone
else&#39;s machine.</p>
<p>This idea of web-first research manifests itself it a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever I&#39;m building an interface, I will try to make it a web app
as opposed to a native GUI.<ul>
<li>Remote collaborators can see what I&#39;m working on without
downloading and compiling code, getting the proper libraries
installed, debugging platform-specific issues, and so on.</li>
<li>Everyone wants scientists to release their code. Once published,
web-based projects are easy to disseminate because they&#39;re already
running in-browser.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For each project, I maintain a private website to track progress,
results, and ideas. If someone misses a meeting, they can just check
the site to see what&#39;s going on.</li>
<li>I like learning new programming languages and frameworks. The web is
constantly evolving, so I have the opportunity to learn and extend
tons of cool web-related technologies and tools. So far in grad
school: <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a>, <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">flask</a>, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a>,
<a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">dojo</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>,
<a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a>, <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">underscore</a>, <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">coffeescript</a>,
<a href="http://docpad.org">docpad</a> and many more. Being able to learn these tools while
I&#39;m doing my research is a highly-motivational mixture of work and
play.</li>
<li>Rapid iteration for the web is, well, rapid. This applies to high-
level languages in general. Sure, algorithms are going to run a bit
slower, but only invest the time in highly optimized implementations
if your research depends on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Web-first research doesn&#39;t make sense for all areas of research, but I
encourage other graduate students (HCI and otherwise) to think about
these things as they&#39;re working on projects.</p>
