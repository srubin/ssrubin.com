            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I started grad school in the Fall of 2011, I didn&amp;#39;t consider
myself to be an excellent programmer or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;hacker&lt;/a&gt; or anything
like that. On the other hand, I did consider myself to be an
exceptional googler and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hci.stanford.edu/research/opportunistic/&quot;&gt;tinkerer&lt;/a&gt;; I could usually scrounge
up a solution to my current programming problem without much
difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first research project in grad school involved a javascript-heavy
experiment that we were going to deploy to Mechanical Turk. I had done
my fair share of tinkering with client-side (HTML/CSS) and server-side
(Rails) web development, but I had always avoided javascript. No, I
don&amp;#39;t know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eager to show my collaborators that I was capable of writing code that
worked and writing it quickly, I dove into javascript&amp;#39;s prototypical
deep end. My code, hideous as it was, worked fine and allowed for
rapid iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to expand on the aforementioned hideousness, we&amp;#39;re talking a
whole mess of global variables and inline HTML:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlighted&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;$(&lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;'body'&lt;/span&gt;).prepend(&lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;'&amp;lt;span id=&quot;codespan&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Enter your code: &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;input style=&quot;display: inline&quot; id=&quot;turkcode&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;turkcode&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/input&amp;gt;&amp;lt;button id=&quot;codebutton&quot;&amp;gt;Submit&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh dear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My intention isn&amp;#39;t to call out how bad I was at javascript a year and
half ago. I was inspired by the process. That project necessitated
that I build a web app, but my projects since then have been more
flexible. But all of my (and your, I&amp;#39;m guessing) research
collaborators have a somewhat unbelievable number of devices that can
access the web, so ideally, my research should live on the web instead
of in some C++ or Java code that may not ever be compiled on anyone
else&amp;#39;s machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea of web-first research manifests itself it a number of ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever I&amp;#39;m building an interface, I will try to make it a web app
as opposed to a native GUI.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote collaborators can see what I&amp;#39;m working on without
downloading and compiling code, getting the proper libraries
installed, debugging platform-specific issues, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone wants scientists to release their code. Once published,
web-based projects are easy to disseminate because they&amp;#39;re already
running in-browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each project, I maintain a private website to track progress,
results, and ideas. If someone misses a meeting, they can just check
the site to see what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like learning new programming languages and frameworks. The web is
constantly evolving, so I have the opportunity to learn and extend
tons of cool web-related technologies and tools. So far in grad
school: &lt;a href=&quot;http://webpy.org/&quot;&gt;web.py&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/&quot;&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.djangoproject.com/&quot;&gt;django&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sqlalchemy.org/&quot;&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dojotoolkit.org/&quot;&gt;dojo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jquery.com/&quot;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://jqueryui.com/&quot;&gt;jQuery UI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://underscorejs.org/&quot;&gt;underscore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeescript.org/&quot;&gt;coffeescript&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://docpad.org&quot;&gt;docpad&lt;/a&gt; and many more. Being able to learn these tools while
I&amp;#39;m doing my research is a highly-motivational mixture of work and
play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid iteration for the web is, well, rapid. This applies to high-
level languages in general. Sure, algorithms are going to run a bit
slower, but only invest the time in highly optimized implementations
if your research depends on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web-first research doesn&amp;#39;t make sense for all areas of research, but I
encourage other graduate students (HCI and otherwise) to think about
these things as they&amp;#39;re working on projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Site redesign</title>
            <link href="http://ssrubin.com/posts/redesign.html"/>

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m working on an (admittedly simple) redesign of my site. I may
change things significantly from this form because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am indecisive, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One obvious difference is that there is a section here for &amp;quot;posts.&amp;quot;
I&amp;#39;m not sure exactly what&amp;#39;s going to become of this section. I might
end up scrapping it in the future. But for now, it&amp;#39;s here. I have a
soft spot for blogging. When I first purchased this domain when I was
in 7th grade, I wrote a blog that was horribly written and often
banal, but my friends kept reading, so I kept writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student, I probably have more interesting things to say
now than I did back then. Probably.&lt;/p&gt;
