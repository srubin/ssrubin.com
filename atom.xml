            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m working on an (admittedly simple) redesign of my site. I may
change things significantly from this form because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am indecisive, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One obvious difference is that there is a section here for &amp;quot;posts.&amp;quot;
I&amp;#39;m not sure exactly what&amp;#39;s going to become of this section. I might
end up scrapping it in the future. But for now, it&amp;#39;s here. I have a
soft spot for blogging. When I first purchased this domain when I was
in 7th grade, I wrote a blog that was horribly written and often
banal, but my friends kept reading, so I kept writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student, I probably have more interesting things to say
now than I did back then. Probably.&lt;/p&gt;
